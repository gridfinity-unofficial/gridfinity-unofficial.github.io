  <h3>Magnets</h3>

  <p> These can be used to supplement the socket and secure blocks in baseplates more reliably.
    The magnets are 6mm diameter, 2mm thickness. Blocks should ideally have holes in all four corners of every unit to ensure compatibility in all rotations. </p>

  <p> Use M3 screws in the corners.</p>


  <h3>Labels</h3>

  <p>Blocks can optionally have labels for easier organisation of your containers. They also provide a lip making it easier to pick up individual blocks.</p>
