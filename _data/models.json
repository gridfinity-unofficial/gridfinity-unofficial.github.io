These work especially well for the [Gridfinity 3D-printer accessory kit](https://bit.ly/3jtTfWu).\n\nIf you need more adjacent slots, just print multiple baseplates and butt them up against each other. *I STRONGLY recommend magnets or screws so you don't knock stuff into your printer!*\n\n**Anycubic Vyper/Kobra**: Also fits any printer made of extrusion with 6mm slots. Mount to your printer's frame with [M5 hammer nuts for 6mm slots](https://amzn.to/3jzbOZb) and [M5x12mm countersunk screws](https://amzn.to/3xoGLHV). Remember to measure countersunk screws from the TOP OF THE HEAD!\n\nThe **sidecar** baseplate mounts to the base frame, parallel with the floor, a lot like the included filament holder. The **top-mount** baseplate mounts on the Z axis crossbeam or base frame. *Make sure the gantry, extruder, and plate don't collide with your Gridfinity!*\n\n**Lulzbot**: Fits the upward-facing edges of the top crossbars. This one is a real pain in the butt to install.\n\n**Prusa**: Slides on over the steel frame, no fasteners required. *THE BASEPLATE AND EXTRUDER MUST BE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE FRAME!*\n\n**Snapmaker**: Mount to the optional enclosure with [M5 hammer nuts for 6mm slots](https://amzn.to/3jzbOZb) and [M5x12mm countersunk screws](https://amzn.to/3xoGLHV). Remember to measure countersunk screws from the TOP OF THE HEAD! I didn't make one for the printer itself, sorry!\n\n**Toolchanger**: Mount to the top of the printer with three button head M3x5 screws. *Don't use longer screws! They won't fit!*\n\n**Gridfinity Tips!**\n- No brims or support required! \n- Use any filament with an 0.6mm or smaller nozzle. \n- Wider bins can curl, so maximize your bed adhesion if you're going big!\n- All storage blocks are compatible with all baseplates!\n- Most storage blocks are stackable!\n- You can add 6x2mm magnets to the corners!

No room for screws or magnets, but saves filament and headroom. If your storage unit is on a steel surface, you can still put magnets in the storage blocks to keep them from sliding.\n\n**Weighted**: Heavy, sturdy baseplate perfect for desktops, shelves, and other places where knocking stuff over is a big problem. \n\nSecure blocks permanently with [M3 screws,](https://amzn.to/37IaXTg) or temporarily with [6x2mm magnets](https://amzn.to/37Ihopq). Add [rubber feet](https://amzn.to/3LZv4v5) to keep the whole shebang from sliding, and [metal tire weights ](https://amzn.to/3uAzH9f)to drop the center of gravity and prevent wipeouts. You don't need to install every magnet, foot, and weight! Just use enough for your needs.\n\nA Prusa i3 Mk3 can print up to a 5x5 grid. No matter what you use, make sure your bed adhesion and release is dialed in - these love to curl, and their high surface area can make them challenging to remove.\n\n**Gridfinity Tips!**\n- No brims or support required! \n- Use any filament with an 0.6mm or smaller nozzle. \n- Wider plates can curl, so maximize your bed adhesion if you're going big!\n- All storage blocks are compatible with all baseplates!\n- Most storage blocks are stackable!\n- You can add 6x2mm magnets to the corners!

Glass is more scratch-resistant than acrylic, and microscope slides come pre-cut to size. \n\nEach bin is made of two parts, the Compartment and the Faceplate. You'll also need:\n- 1x3 Microscope slides: https://amzn.to/3O6qjBO\n- 2mm Repair Tape: https://amzn.to/3M1D9zF\n\nHow to assemble:\n1. Apply two strips of tape to the microscope slides, touching the short edges.\n2. Stick that slide to the faceplate.\n3. Apply two strips of tape down the short sides of the faceplate, over the glass.\n4. Apply a third strip along the bottom. It will curl a little around the bottom.\n5. Slap that crap onto the divider bins. Press hard.\n\nThese are perfect for storing small parts, especially if you plan to stack 'em up. The big window makes it easy to check what's inside and monitor your supply levels.\n\nThe inner surface has a generous scoop to make retrieving parts easy, and the tab fits 12mm label-maker tape.\n\nI've provided a selection of different divider counts, to give you OPTIONS! Because microscope slides are only available in one size, only 2-unit-wide bins are possible.\n\nBrims and support are not required, and these can be printed in any filament with an 0.6mm or smaller nozzle. \n\n**Gridfinity Tips!**\n- All storage blocks are compatible with all baseplates!\n- Most storage blocks are stackable!\n- You can add 6x2mm magnets to the corners!

    "description": "Versatile open-top storage blocks for the Gridfinity modular workshop storage system - multiple sizes for infinite options!\n\nGridfinity is the ultimate organizer for your whole workshop! Learn more at  \nFind more Gridfinity accessories at https://bit.ly/3E2NxnZ\n\nParametric source file: https://a360.co/3vbu9B5\n\nThese are perfect for storing small parts and long, thin objects like needle files, and you can stack them as high as you want! The inner surface has a generous scoop to make retrieving parts easy, and the tab fits 12mm label-maker tape.\n\nI've provided a selection of different sizes and divider counts, to give you OPTIONS! Note that none of the compartment sizes overlap - there isn't a two-compartment 4x1 bin because you can just use two one-compartment 2x1 bins.\n\nDimensions in file names are Width x Depth x Height. Width and Depth units are 42mm grid slots, Height is in 7mm units. A Prusa i3 Mk3S can fit a five-unit-wide bin on its plate.\n\nNote that two-unit-high bins don't have labels - they would cut too far into the usable storage area.\n\nBrims and support are not required, and these can be printed in any filament with an 0.6mm or smaller nozzle. Wider bins can curl, so maximize your bed adhesion if you're going big!\n\n**Gridfinity Tips!**\n- All storage blocks are compatible with all baseplates!\n- Most storage blocks are stackable!\n- You can add 6x2mm magnets to the corners! They won't magnetize the contents.\n- You can also use M3 screws in the corners.",

These work great for nippers, flush cutters, wire strippers, pliers, scissors, crimpers, nibblers, cutters, and punch-down tools.\n\n*These storage blocks are extra-big and tend to curl! Use a brim and ensure good bed adhesion.* \n\n**Nipper Holder**: Holds six tools about 80mm from handle to handle. If the tool is spring-loaded, the undercut will keep it from falling out. This can be mounted sideways to store five tools.\n\n**Stripper Holder**: Holds two wire strippers or other long, slim hand tools up to 18mm thicc. I've prepared two sizes - 200mm is your usual multi-hole wire stripper, and 160mm fits many crimpers and termination tools. Both should fit on most printers.\n\n**Gridfinity Tips!**\n- Use any filament with an 0.6mm or smaller nozzle. \n- All storage blocks are compatible with all baseplates!\n- Most storage blocks are stackable!\n- You can add 6x2mm magnets to the corners! They won't magnetize the contents.\n- You can also use M3 screws in the corners.",
