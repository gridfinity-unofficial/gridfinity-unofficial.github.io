## Building the project locally

This project is built using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator.

In order to build the project locally, you will first need to install the requirements for Jekyll. Instructions for your
specific operating system can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Once Ruby is installed, you will need to install Bundler by running `gem install bundler` in your command line.

With bundler installed, you can simply navigate to the project's directory and run `bundle install` to install all 
required gems.

With all gems installed, you can start serving jekyll locally using `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
